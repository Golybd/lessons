            <p><span id="game_name">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</span> is the third and final installment in the series of
                games developed by <span style="color: red">CD PROJEKT RED</span> featuring the witcher Geralt of Rivia.
                The game was originally scheduled for release in late 2014, then pushed back to 24 February 2015, and
                finally released on 19 May 2015. During the first two weeks since release it had sold more than 4
                million copies worldwide, more than doubling the total sales of its predecessor, The Witcher 2:
                Assassins of Kings.</p>

                <p class="paragraph text">The world is in chaos. The air is thick with tension and the smoke of burnt
                    villages. The fearsome
                    Empire of Nilfgaard has struck again, ravaging the helpless Northern Kingdoms. The once mighty who
                    tried to use Geralt for their own gain are now gone. In these uncertain times, no one can say what
                    fortune holds in store, who will bring peace to the world and who will cause it only misery. But a
                    force darker and deadlier emerges.</p>
                <p>The petty men and women commanding tin-plated armies fail to understand that their conflict is
                    child's play compared to the Wild Hunt, the otherworldly threat which now looms. These ghastly
                    spectral riders have for ages plagued humankind, bringing misery to the world. This time the Wild
                    Hunt seeks one person in particular: the one individual Destiny itself bestowed upon Geralt, the one
                    soul Geralt considers kin.</p>

                As CD PROJEKT RED, we strongly believe this is not the way it should work and, with The Witcher 3:
                Wild
                Hunt​​​, we have decided to do it differently. Cutting to the chase, everyone who buys Wild Hunt
                will
                receive 16 specially prepared DLCs absolutely for free, regardless of platform. You don't have to
                preorder, you don't have to buy any special edition to get them — if you own a copy of Wild Hunt,
                they're yours. This is our way of saying thank you for buying our game.

            <p class="expansions_text">On April 7, 2015, CD PROJEKT RED announced two major expansions for The
                Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,
                entitled
                Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.[13] CD PROJEKT RED said that both expansion packs included new
                enemies, characters, and gear. Players would also be reunited with some "dearly missed" characters
                from
                the series. Hearts of Stone was released on October 13, 2015, and Blood and Wine on May 31, 2016,
                both
                are available on all three major platforms. Players can purchase both expansions at once by getting
                the
                Expansion Pass, now on sale through several retailers.</p>
